    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      At Gull Family Orchards, we’re building on a legacy of hard work, community, and farming. Over the last year, I’ve had the honor of learning from some of the most knowledgeable farmers, and I’m especially grateful for the insights I’ve gained from mentors in both the business and practical sides of almond farming. With the help of an incredible network of farmers here in Oakdale, we’re focused on creating a successful future rooted in respect for the land, family, and the values that shape this community.

    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      At Gull Family Orchards, we believe in cultivating more than just crops. We’re committed to growing a family legacy, one that is rooted in tradition, sustainability, and a respect for the land. Our goal is to produce the highest quality almonds while caring for the environment, contributing to the local economy, and building a lasting legacy for future generations.
