    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      As a software engineer by trade, I’ve always had a passion for problem-solving and innovation. However, my heart has always been tied to nature and the land. After years of working in technology, I decided to pursue a lifelong dream of running my own farm and becoming a part of California’s rich agricultural tradition. With the guidance of my grandpa, a veteran and lifelong farmer, I’ve embraced the challenge of farming, blending modern techniques with time-honored practices to create a thriving orchard that reflects our family’s dedication to quality and sustainability.

    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      A retired Marine and lifelong farmer, my grandpa brings a wealth of experience and wisdom to Gull Family Orchards. Having grown up working on a dairy farm and later serving his community as a Deputy Sheriff for Alemeda County for 31 years, he knows the value of hard work, discipline, and perseverance. His background in agriculture and his hands-on knowledge of farming have been instrumental in guiding our growth. Even in retirement, his passion for farming and dedication to family fuels our vision for the future.
