    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      At Gull Family Orchards, we’re building on a legacy of hard work, community, and farming. Over the last year, I’ve had the honor of learning from some of the most knowledgeable farmers, and I’m especially grateful for the insights I’ve gained from mentors in both the business and practical sides of almond farming. With the help of an incredible network of farmers here in Oakdale, we’re focused on creating a successful future rooted in respect for the land, family, and the values that shape this community.

      As a Senior Software & Machine Learning Engineer with extensive experience, I’ve built a career around solving complex challenges and driving innovation in the tech industry. My expertise spans cutting-edge projects, including developing a high-precision parity checker for VMware and collaborating with leading institutions like the Genomics Institute. Through these ventures, I’ve not only honed my technical skills but also established a solid foundation of financial success, enabling me to pursue new opportunities.

      While technology has been at the core of my professional journey, my passion for nature and sustainable agriculture has always remained close to my heart. Inspired by my grandpa, a lifelong farmer and veteran, I’ve transitioned into a new chapter—combining my entrepreneurial spirit and financial resources to build a thriving orchard in California. By merging advanced technology with traditional farming practices, I aim to create a sustainable and innovative agricultural operation that honors my family’s legacy while contributing to the future of farming.

      A retired Marine and lifelong farmer, my grandpa brings a wealth of experience and wisdom to Gull Family Orchards. Having grown up working on a dairy farm and later serving his community as a lituenent Deputy Sheriff for Alameda County for 31 years, he knows the value of hard work, discipline, and perseverance. His background in agriculture and his hands-on knowledge of farming have been instrumental in guiding our growth. Even in retirement, his passion for farming and dedication to family fuels our vision for the future.
